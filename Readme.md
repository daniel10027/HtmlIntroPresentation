## 4. HTML Syntax and Document Structure üèóÔ∏è

### 4.1 Basic Document Template

Every HTML document follows a standard structure. Here‚Äôs an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph to illustrate HTML structure.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4.2 Key Concepts

- **Doctype Declaration:** `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that the document is HTML5.
- **Elements:** Building blocks of HTML (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`).
- **Attributes:** Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `src`, `alt`, `class`).

## 5. Essential HTML Elements and Tags üîë

### 5.1 Structural Elements

- **`<html>`:** The root element that wraps the entire document.
- **`<head>`:** Contains metadata, title, and links to scripts or stylesheets.
- **`<body>`:** Contains all the content that is visible to the user.

### 5.2 Text Content and Formatting

- **Headings:** `<h1>` to `<h6>` for creating titles and subtitles.
- **Paragraphs:** `<p>` for regular text blocks.
- **Emphasis:** `<strong>` and `<em>` for bold and italicized text.
- **Line Breaks:** `<br>` to force a line break.
- **Blockquotes:** `<blockquote>` for quoting text.

### 5.3 Hyperlinks and Images

- **Links:** `<a href="URL">Link Text</a>` creates a clickable hyperlink.
- **Images:** `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">` embeds images.

### 5.4 Lists

- **Unordered Lists:** `<ul>` with `<li>` for bullet points.
- **Ordered Lists:** `<ol>` with `<li>` for numbered items.
- **Definition Lists:** `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` for key-value pairs.

### 5.5 Tables

- **Structure:** Use `<table>`, `<tr>` (rows), `<th>` (headers), and `<td>` (cells) to display tabular data.

### 5.6 Forms and Inputs

- **Form Container:** `<form>` encapsulates form elements.
- **Input Fields:** `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>` for user inputs.
- **Attributes:** Utilize attributes like `name`, `type`, and `placeholder` to enhance form functionality.

### 5.7 Multimedia Elements

- **Audio:** `<audio controls>` embeds sound files.
- **Video:** `<video controls>` embeds video files.
- **Source:** `<source>` defines media sources for audio or video elements.

### 5.8 Semantic Elements

Semantic elements give meaning to your content:
- **`<header>`:** Contains introductory content or navigation links.
- **`<nav>`:** Defines navigation sections.
- **`<article>`:** Represents a self-contained piece of content.
- **`<section>`:** Groups related content together.
- **`<aside>`:** Contains content tangentially related to the main content.
