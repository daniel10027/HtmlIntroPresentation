## 2. What is HTML? 🤔

- **Definition:** HTML is a markup language used to create the structure of web pages.
- **Purpose:** It organizes content, embeds media, and sets the foundation for web design.

## 3. A Brief History of HTML ⏳

- **Origins:** Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
- **Evolution:** From the initial simple versions to the robust HTML5 standard used today.
- **HTML4 vs HTML5:** HTML5 introduced semantic elements, native multimedia support, and advanced APIs that enable richer web experiences.

## 4. HTML Syntax and Document Structure 🏗️

### 4.1 Basic Document Template

Every HTML document follows a standard structure. Here’s an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph to illustrate HTML structure.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4.2 Key Concepts

- **Doctype Declaration:** `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that the document is HTML5.
- **Elements:** Building blocks of HTML (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`).
- **Attributes:** Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `src`, `alt`, `class`).

## 5. Essential HTML Elements and Tags 🔑

### 5.1 Structural Elements

- **`<html>`:** The root element that wraps the entire document.
- **`<head>`:** Contains metadata, title, and links to scripts or stylesheets.
- **`<body>`:** Contains all the content that is visible to the user.

### 5.2 Text Content and Formatting

- **Headings:** `<h1>` to `<h6>` for creating titles and subtitles.
- **Paragraphs:** `<p>` for regular text blocks.
- **Emphasis:** `<strong>` and `<em>` for bold and italicized text.
- **Line Breaks:** `<br>` to force a line break.
- **Blockquotes:** `<blockquote>` for quoting text.

### 5.3 Hyperlinks and Images

- **Links:** `<a href="URL">Link Text</a>` creates a clickable hyperlink.
- **Images:** `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">` embeds images.

### 5.4 Lists

- **Unordered Lists:** `<ul>` with `<li>` for bullet points.
- **Ordered Lists:** `<ol>` with `<li>` for numbered items.
- **Definition Lists:** `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` for key-value pairs.

### 5.5 Tables

- **Structure:** Use `<table>`, `<tr>` (rows), `<th>` (headers), and `<td>` (cells) to display tabular data.

### 5.6 Forms and Inputs

- **Form Container:** `<form>` encapsulates form elements.
- **Input Fields:** `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>` for user inputs.
- **Attributes:** Utilize attributes like `name`, `type`, and `placeholder` to enhance form functionality.

### 5.7 Multimedia Elements

- **Audio:** `<audio controls>` embeds sound files.
- **Video:** `<video controls>` embeds video files.
- **Source:** `<source>` defines media sources for audio or video elements.

### 5.8 Semantic Elements

Semantic elements give meaning to your content:
- **`<header>`:** Contains introductory content or navigation links.
- **`<nav>`:** Defines navigation sections.
- **`<article>`:** Represents a self-contained piece of content.
- **`<section>`:** Groups related content together.
- **`<aside>`:** Contains content tangentially related to the main content.
- **`<footer>`:** Defines the footer of a document or section.

## 6. HTML Attributes and Global Attributes 📝

- **Attributes:** Key-value pairs that modify elements.
- **Global Attributes:** Applicable to most HTML elements (e.g., `id`, `class`, `style`, `title`, `data-*`).
- **Usage Example:** 
  ```html
  <div id="main" class="container" data-info="example">
      Content goes here.
  </div>
  ```

## 7. Best Practices for Writing HTML ✍️

- **Semantic Markup:** Use elements according to their purpose for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Accessibility:** Include `alt` text for images, proper labels for forms, and use ARIA roles when necessary.
- **Clean Code:** Use consistent indentation, meaningful naming conventions, and comments to improve code readability.
- **Responsive Design:** Add the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag and use responsive CSS techniques.

## 8. HTML5 Enhancements and New Features 🚀

- **Semantic Tags:** Improved document structure with tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`.
- **Multimedia Support:** Native audio and video playback with `<audio>` and `<video>`.
- **APIs:** Enhanced capabilities such as the Canvas API, Geolocation, and Drag & Drop.
- **Form Improvements:** New input types like `email`, `date`, and `number` that enhance user experience.
- **Offline Storage:** Local storage and session storage APIs to manage data locally on the client side.
